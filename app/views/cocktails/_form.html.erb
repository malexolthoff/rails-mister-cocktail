<!-- This is a simple form. It is specifically set for @cocktail, which ties its path to the cocktail variable.
f.input :name sets the name of the cocktail, and placeholder sets the value Caesar as a background text
until the user inputs text.
f.button :submit creates a submit button with an associated post action. The class btn btn primary makes this submit
a blue button -->
